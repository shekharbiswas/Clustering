# Project 1 :
Dataset for clustering users by cognitive profiles, we need to consider various features that reflect different aspects of cognitive abilities. 

## Dataset Explanation

- User_ID: Unique identifier for each user.
- Memory_Score: Score reflecting the user's performance in memory exercises.
- Attention_Score: Score reflecting the user's performance in attention exercises.
- Flexibility_Score: Score reflecting the user's performance in cognitive flexibility exercises.
- Problem_Solving_Score: Score reflecting the user's performance in problem-solving exercises.
- Average_Response_Time: Average time (in seconds) taken by the user to respond to exercises.
- Session_Frequency: Number of sessions the user completes per week.
- Improvement_Rate: Rate of improvement in user's scores over a certain period.


# Project 2 :
A/B Testing for Feature Impact on User Engagement

## Description:
Design and conduct an A/B test to evaluate the impact of a new feature on user engagement metrics for a hypothetical mobile app. 
The goal is to determine whether the new feature leads to a statistically significant increase in user engagement compared to the existing feature.
